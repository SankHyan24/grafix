## Whitted-Style Ray Tracing

## Why Ray Tracing?
- Rasterization couldn't handle global effects well
    - Soft shadow
    - Light bounces more than once
- Ray Tracing is accurate, but is very **slow**
    - Rasterization: *real-time*, ray tracing: *offline*
    - ~10k CPU core hours to render one frame in production.
## Definition:
1. Light Rays:
    1. Light travels in straight lines 直线传播
    2. Light rays do not collide with each other if they cross 不相互影响
    3. Light rays travel from the light sources to the eye (but the physics is invariant under the path reversal - reciprocity) 光路可逆
2. Ray Casting
    1. Generate an image by casting one ray per pixel.
    2. Check forshadows by sending a ray to the light.
